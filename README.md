# city-canvas

A full stack web application for street art enthusiasts who want to locate, share, and save street art in their city and beyond.

## Why City Canvas Was Built

City Canvas fills a void in the art-based image sharing social media realm. After spending too much time enduring the frustrations of searching social media platforms for street art and publicly accessible art installations near me, the idea of creating a web application for the specific purpose of sharing and locating street art was born. City Canvas serves this purpose without all the other distractions of alternative social media platforms.
