# city-canvas

A full stack web application for street art enthusiasts who want to locate, share, and save street art in their city and beyond.

## Why City Canvas Was Built

City canvas fills a void in the art-based social media realm. After spending too much time digging through other social media sites for street art and publicly accessible art installations, and swimming in frustration try to locate certain murals and sculptures, the idea of creating a web application for the specific reason of sharing and locating street art was born. It serves this specific set of needs without all the other distractions.
